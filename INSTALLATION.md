## #1. Requirement Check

        -- If not Please visit the site(https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest stable version.

    b. To check npm version, use `npm -v`. 
        It should give version number. like: 7.15.1 
        -- It won't work if there's no node version (above one)

    c. To check pm2 installed or not use `pm2 --version`
        It should give version number. like: 5.1.0 
        -- If not Please visit the site(https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) and download the latest stable version.
                    or

        -- If not please use `npm i nodemon -g` to install latest one.
    e. MySQL & Mongo creds are compulsory, so Please follow proper way to install it in local system or use cloud creds.
    

## #2. Set Environment for NODE

## 1. `Open the Terminal in Root Directory (current folder)`

`For windows environment`
```code
    set NODE_ENV=development
```

`For linux || mac environment`
```code
    export NODE_ENV=development
```

## #3. Installing Node Packages in all folders

```code
cd ./socioboard-api/User & npm install & cd ../Feeds & npm install & cd ../Common & npm install & cd ../Update & npm install & cd ../Publish & npm install & cd ../Notification & npm install
```


## #4. Setting up MySQL Database

    A. Setting the config file for Database connections.

        Open the config.json file located at `socioboard-api\Common\Sequelize-cli\config\config.json`

        And Update The below mentioned keys in `development` key
                        "username": "<< DB USER NAME >>",
                        "database": "<< Database name >>",
                        "password": "<< password >>",
                        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        and save the file.

    B. Creating Tables.
         run `set NODE_ENV=development & npx sequelize-cli db:migrate` command in `socioboard-api\Common\Sequelize-cli`

         or Run this command in root directory.

         `cd socioboard-api\Common\Sequelize-cli & npx sequelize-cli db:migrate` 

         It should list all the tables it creating without any errors.

    C. Setting up migrations.
        As you're in the Sequelize-cli folder you can simply run `npx sequelize-cli db:seed --seed 20210303111816-initialize_application_informations.cjs` command. 

        It will add data into single table.

## #5. Updating the config files (minimum required should fill with proper details)
        Most important is we need to setup mongo and mysql objects values properly in all config folders. 

        Ex: in `User` folder `config/development.json` file and fill the << Description >> places with correct files.

```diff       
- Note: In all folders update the configuration files properly.
```

## #6. Starting the micro-services

    Make sure you're in Root directory.

    For starting User micro service you need to go to User folder Then run `nodemon user.server.js` and it should start in port 3000(which is configured in `development.json` file)

```diff
+ We should do this in rest 3 micro services as well.
```

### `Note:` If you facing any issue, in that same folder you need to go to resources/Log/ResponseLog folder and check the proper log file to fix it.


### `If you want to run all with pm2`

    Your Terminal should be in Root Directory. then run the below command.

```code
set NODE_ENV=development & cd ./socioboard-api/User & pm2 user.server.js & cd ../Feeds & pm2 feeds.server.js & ../Publish & pm2 publish.server.js & cd ../Notification & pm2 notify.server.js & cd ../Update & pm2 update.server.js & pm2 status
```

    It will Give you all your services status in a table.
